# User Authentication Setup Complete

## What's Been Added

### Database Changes
- **New User Model**: Users now have email, password, and authentication fields
- **Guess Model**: Individual guesses are now tracked separately and linked to users
- **UserStats Model**: Tracks individual player statistics (games played, wins, win rate)
- **Authentication Models**: Account, Session, and VerificationToken for NextAuth.js

### Authentication System
- **NextAuth.js Integration**: Full authentication system with credentials provider
- **Registration/Login Pages**: `/auth/signup` and `/auth/signin`
- **User Profile Page**: `/profile` shows individual stats and guess history
- **Protected Guessing**: Users must be logged in to submit guesses

### UI Updates
- **Navigation Header**: Shows login status, sign in/out buttons
- **User Form**: Now shows authenticated user and requires login
- **Profile Dashboard**: Personal statistics and guess history

## Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

To generate a secret key:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Features

### For Players
- **User Registration**: Email/password account creation
- **Secure Login**: Persistent sessions across browser visits
- **Personal Stats**: Track games played, wins, and win rate
- **Guess History**: View all past guesses and results
- **One Guess Per Game**: Users can only submit one guess per game

### For Admins
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Old admin functions still work
- **User Management**: Can still mark winners and manage games
- **Statistics**: Enhanced data tracking per user

## Database Schema

### User Accounts
- Users sign up with name, email, and password
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Each user gets automatic stats tracking

### Guess Tracking
- Each guess is linked to a specific user
- Prevents duplicate scores per game
- Tracks when guesses were made
- Marks winners individually

### User Statistics
- Total games played
- Total wins
- Best score achieved
- Last played date
- Calculated win rate

## Testing the System

1. **Start the server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000
3. **Sign up**: Create a new account
4. **Submit a guess**: Try the new authenticated guess system
5. **View profile**: Check your stats at `/profile`

## Migration Notes

⚠️ **Data Loss**: The database migration removed existing user data to implement the new authentication system. This is expected for the upgrade to user accounts.

## Next Steps

The authentication system is now fully functional. Users can:
- Create accounts and sign in
- Submit guesses (one per game)
- Track their personal statistics
- View their guess history
- Access their profile dashboard

All existing game functionality (team scores, timers, admin features) continues to work as before.
